# Example Project: Sakib's Tea House
Welcome to my tea house! Browse and add to my collection with the help of components, props, state, forms, routes, and styling.

## Getting Started
This is the app's frontend. Run `npm start` to see it in your browser, and open up `src/index.js` to learn more about how it works.
